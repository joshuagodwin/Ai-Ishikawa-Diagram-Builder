This is the backend service for a fishbone diagram maker that uses ai to quickly come up with categories of causes, causes, etc.
This is a one day build meant to experiment with gemeni. As of 2024.05.31 only the category creation is complete.

In order to use please note that poetry is used for managing dependencies and a .env file must be created with a GEMENI_API_KEY.
